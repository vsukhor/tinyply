// Tinyply can be used both as a header-only and as a precompiled library.
// This file is only needed if you prefer the latter.
// If on the ohter hand you prefer to use the headers alone, you may undef this
// and just include either 'tinyply.h' or each of 'reader.h' or 'writer.h'
// directly into your project and define this:
#define TINYPLY_AS_LIBRARY

#include "reader.h"
#include "writer.h"
